# Dense_Associative_Memory

An example of Dense Associative Memory training with a backpropagation algorithm on MNIST. Based on the paper [Dense Associative Memory for Pattern Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01164) by Dmitry Krotov and John Hopfield. If you want to learn more about Dense Associative Memories, check out a [NIPS 2016 talk](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Neural-Information-Processing-Systems-Conference/Neural-Information-Processing-Systems-Conference-NIPS-2016/Dense-Associative-Memory-for-Pattern-Recognition) or a [research seminar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvuAU_3t134). 

## Getting started

install jupyter notebook and numpy, scipy, matplotlib.

```bash
> jupyter notebook
```
run `Dense_Associative_Memory_training.ipynb` and observe the weights together with the errors on the training and the test sets.
