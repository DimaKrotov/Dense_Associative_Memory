# Dense_Associative_Memory

An example of Dense Associative Memory training with a backpropagation algorithm on MNIST. Based on the paper [Dense Associative Memory for Pattern Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01164) by Dmitry Krotov and John Hopfield. If you want to learn more about Dense Associative Memories, check out a [NIPS 2016 talk](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/events/neural-information-processing-systems-conference-nips-2016/dense-associative-memory-pattern-recognition) or a [research seminar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvuAU_3t134). 

## Getting started

install jupyter notebook and numpy, scipy, matplotlib.

```bash
> jupyter notebook
```
run `Dense_Associative_Memory_training.ipynb` and observe the weights together with the errors on the training and the test sets.
